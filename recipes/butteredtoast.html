        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Are you feeling lazy? Do you lack imagination? Are you a terrible cook? I am currently all of those things, which is why my first recipe 
            will be buttered toast.
        </p>
        <p>What is a buttered toast? It is, to put it simply, toast that has had a layer of butter applied to one side.</p>
        <p>With that being said, while the idea behind a buttered toast is simple, learning how to make a great buttered toast requires hard work and dedication. This recipe will teach
            you how to do so in a safe and methodical way.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>For those who have mastered the art of making buttered toast:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 slice of bread</li>
            <li>A suitable amount of butter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For those who have not yet done so:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple loaves of bread (of the same brand and type)</li>
            <li>A large tub of butter</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Typically bread will come in a plastic bag with a plastic tie. The ends of this tie can be sharp, and can potentially lead to cuts if not careful.
                When removing the tie, take care to not touch the ends of this tie, instead holding the tie by the part adjactent to the ends. If you do not have
                strength to do this, then it is possible to make use of a pair of tweezers or other device to safely remove it.</p>
                <p>Once removed, safely place the tie somewhere where there is no risk of you accidentally touching or stepping on it. Remember to avoid touching
                    the ends of the tie during this step.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You are now ready to remove the bread from the packaging. Reach into the bag and, <strong>gently</strong> holding the bread by one of it's edges, 
                    pull out the bread slice and place it on a plate.
                </p>
                <p>It is important to ensure that you hold the bread in the correct way. Failure to do so could result in a hole or tear in the bread, leading to an unevenly
                    toasted bread or potentially even a toaster fire.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once you have finished doing this, reattach the plastic tie to the bag of bread. Take care to not touch the ends of the plastic tie while doing this.</p>
                <p>If you have removed the final slice of bread at this step, make sure to safely dispose of the bag and tie. The plastic bag can represent
                    a choking hazard to young children, <strong>so it is important to make sure to do this.</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is now time to place the slice of bread in the toaster. Holding the bread gently by one of it's edges, place the bread in the toaster.</p> 
                <p> If the bread is not square shaped, then ensure
                    that the surface area of the bread exposed to the heating element of the toaster is maximised, as this will lead to a more evenly toasted toast.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>There will typically be an adjustable dial on the toaster. While the number selected by the dial
                    will have an impact on how the bread is toasted, noone can explain what the numbers are supposed to mean or what effect will be produced by the toaster
                    as a result of the number selected.
                </p>
                <p><em>It is best to not ask too many questions about this.</em> Each toaster is different, and you will have to build a relationship and understanding with the toaster over time.</p>
                <p>If you are toasting bread with a toaster that you don't have a good relationship with, then make sure to grab a stopwatch, notebook, and oven glove for the next step.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A warning before going any further: <strong>never leave a toaster unattended.</strong> In the event of a toaster fire, you need to be ready to act fast. <strong>Read through this
                <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Put-Out-a-Toaster-Fire">article</a></strong>, and only after you have learned what to do and purchased the appropriate equipment, continue with this guide.</p>
                <p>You are now ready to start toasting the bread. If you really understand your toaster, then you know what to do.</p>
                <p>If you don't, then you will need to experiment with different settings and different timings. You are advised to take a systematic approach to this. Starting with the lowest setting
                    you can select with the dial, pull down the lever and start the stopwatch. Get your notebook and pen ready. After 30 seconds have elapsed you will need to (quickly): </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Press the cancel button.</li>
                    <li>Put on the oven glove.</li>
                    <li>Remove the toast (with the hand you have the oven glove on).</li>
                    <li>Inspect the toast.</li>
                    <li>Bite the toast.</li>
                    <li>Place the toast back in the toaster.</li>
                    <li>Pull down the lever.</li>
                    <li>Restart the timer.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>While waiting for the next 30 seconds to elapse, note down the time elapsed and your experience with the toast. How toasted is the toast? How does it look? How does it feel? 
                    How does it make you feel?
                </p>
                <p>Repeat the steps above until you reach a point where you feel the toast is starting to become too hot to eat immediately. At this point, press the cancel button, remove the toast using an oven glove, and place it back
                    on the plate. Start the timer, and make sure to note down again the time elapsed and your experience with the toast.
                </p>
                <p>After 30 seconds have elapsed, put on the oven glove, grab the toast, and take a bite out of it. Note your experiences and repeat until the bread is cold and unsatisfying.</p>
                <p>After having done this, give your toaster 10 minutes to recuperate and regain it's strength. Then, follow the steps above to place another slice of bread in the toaster, 
                    and keep it in the toaster until another 30 seconds have elapsed from where you stopped last time. Take the toast out of the toaster, try it every 30 seconds and take notes.
                </p>
                <p>Keep following the above step until you get toast that is burnt. Then, turn the dial to the next larger number, and repeat the steps above to understand how the bread is
                    is toasted for that number. Keep repeating this step until there you have done the process for the highest number that can be selected by the dial.
                </p>
                <p>Having done all of this, you should now have a good understanding of how your toaster toasts the bread it is supplied with. It is possible to further experiment by leaving
                    the bread in the toaster for times between those you have found enjoyable for a certain number on the dial, and you are encouraged to do this every time you make toast.

            <li>
                <p>After having built an understanding of how your toaster toasts toast, you are now ready to learn how to apply butter to the toast using a knife (while fingers or other devices
                    can be used, a knife is best for a quick and even spread (if using your finger, make sure that the bread has cooled suffienctly, lest you burn your finger)).
                </p>
                <p>While butter can be spread with any knife, a butter knife is the best choice, and before you handle the knife, you need to learn about knife safety. Read through this 
                    <a href="https://www.stockland.com.au/shopping-centres/everyday-ideas/recipe/jamies-ministry-of-food-how-to/how-to-use-knives-safely">article</a> for more information, but to
                    summarise:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Secure your chopping board/plate.</li>
                    <li>Never wave a knife in the air.</li>
                    <li>Take your time.</li>
                    <li>Don't leave your knives lying around</li>
                    <li>Sharpen your knives.</li>
                    <li>Always hold a knife in your dominant hand.</li>
                    <li>Don't invite Michael Myers over for a dinner party.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Having learnt about knife safety, we can proceed. Firstly, toast a slice of bread in a way that you find enjoyable. Then, grab a weighing scale, a notebook, and a pen. Open the tub of butter, turn on the scale, place the tub of butter on
                    the scale, grab the pen, note down the weight displayed on the weighing scale, and then place the pen and notebook out of the way.
                </p>
                <p> Hold the knife handle in your dominant hand and, while keeping the knife at a 45Â° angle, apply a light amount of
                    downward and horizontal force through the knife and into the butter to place butter on the butter knife itself (if you are unsure about how much force to apply, start with a small 
                    amount of force and gradually increase the amount of force applied until you achieve the desired result). Apply the butter to the toast using a sweeping motion with the knife,
                    and continue to add butter until you think you have applied the right amount.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note down the weight of the tub of butter after having applied the butter and subtract it from the starting weight to find out the amount of butter used. Try the buttered toast and note
                    your experience with it. By experimenting with how long you wait after cooking the toast before applying the butter, how evenly you spread the butter, and how much butter you apply (among other things), you
                    will be able to find a way to make buttered toast that is just right for you every time! You are again encouraged to perform this experimentation in a careful, systematic way.

        <h2>Additional Comments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>No two types of bread are the same, and the same applies for different types of butter.</p>
                <p>When using different brands for the same type of bread or butter, it is fine to use the knowledge and experience you have gained from before as a starting point. However, when
                    using a new type of bread or butter, you are strongly advised to take an approach to experimentation similar to the one described earlier to better understand how to best make buttered
                    toast using those new ingredients.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>It is important to take good care of your toaster. No two toasters are the same, and replacing a toaster will mean that all of the knowledge you have gained on how it
                toasts your bread will be lost. Read through the instruction manual and guides online to make sure that you clean, maintain, and use the toaster in the correct way.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Toasters raise a number of interesting philosophical questions. How should we define bread? How should we define toast? At what point does bread become toast? These are not easy questions to answer. I have decided not to address questions like these
                in this recipe so that it can be short and focused, and I have used the terms bread and toast somewhat interchangeably at points as a result.</p>
