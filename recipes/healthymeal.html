    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Do you want to eat healthy? Do you want to save time on preparing meals and cleaning while doing so?</p>
    <p>If so, then it would be worthwhile to try doing meal prep to see if it's right for you.</p>
    <p>Meal prep is the practice of preparing part or all of a meal before you plan to eat it. Typically you will
        prepare multiple meals (or partial meals) in one go, and then store them in
        a freezer or refrigerator to be reheated or used later. Meal prep will make it easier to eat meals that contain
        healthy, unprocessed wholefoods, which typically aren't contained in
        other quick and convenient food options.
    </p>
    <p>You can find many different articles and videos online that show you how others approach doing this. In what
        follows, I will present a meal prep recipe that focuses on good nutrition and
        speed of preparation, while neglecting taste. The recipe described below should make 6 fairly bulky meals in
        approximately 60 minutes, and will require 6 fairly large food containers.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 broccoli head (medium to large)</li>
        <li>1 cauliflower (medium to large)</li>
        <li>1 bag of kale (roughly 250g)</li>
        <li>1 bag of brussels sprouts (roughly 300g)</li>
        <li>1 bag of spinach (roughly 250g)</li>
        <li>1 bag of asparagus tips</li>
        <li>225g of wholewheat dried pasta</li>
        <li>12 freerange eggs</li>
        <li>6 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>preferred seasonings for the chicken breast</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>The chicken breasts in this recipe will be oven cooked, while the other items will be boiled. It doesn't matter
        when you do one or the other, so I will split the recipe in two to make it clearer, despite normally doing
        both simultaneously. If you keep your eggs in the fridge, then take them out beforehand so that they can warm up
        to room temperature before cooking (this will mean they are less likely to crack).
    </p>

    <h3>Chicken</h3>
    <p>Instructions below are for normal sized chicken breasts (roughly 175g per breast). Make sure to follow the
        cooking instructions if chicken breasts are of a different size.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wrap a large oven tray with aluminium foil, and place it in the oven.</li>
        <li>Start preheating the oven at 200°C / fan 180°C.
            <p>(Normally at this point I will start boiling the water, in the expectation that it will be boiling by the
                time the chicken is cooking in the oven- see the first two instructions of the "Other ingredients"
                section)</p>
        </li>
        <li>Once preheated, add the 6 chicken breasts to the tray, season with your preferred seasonings, and place back
            in the oven.</li>
        <li>Wait for 25-30 minutes depending on your preference for how well cooked it should be, and then remove
            chicken breasts from the oven. Check that the chicken breast is cooked throughout.</li>
        <li>Place the tray of chicken breasts to the side to cool </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Other Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan with water until it is about 40% full (the percentage is hard for me to judge from
            memory, and you'll get a feel for it with experience), and begin heating it at the highest setting.</li>
        <li>Typically you'll have to wait a bit before the oven is preheated and the water is boiling. You can use this
            time to break up the broccoli and cauliflower into manageable pieces and wash the vegetables.
            To quickly wash the vegetables, pierce several holes into the bottom of the plastic bag they come in (you
            can place the broccoli in the other plastic bags if there is space) and run water through them.
        </li>
        <li>Once the water has started simmering (the chicken breasts should be in the oven at this point), pour some
            salt into the saucepan and mix into the water.</li>
        <li>Grab a timer or open up a timing app on your phone. Weigh out 75g of pasta, place said pasta in the
            saucepan, and start the timer afterwards.</li>
        <li>Once 30 seconds have elapsed, gently place 4 eggs into the saucepan using a spoon.</li>
        <li>After 4 minutes have elapsed, place a third of the brussels sprouts into the saucepan.</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes have elapsed, place a third of the kale into the saucepan.</li>
        <li>After 6 minutes have elapsed, place a third of the cauliflower into the saucepan.</li>
        <li>After 7 minutes have elapsed, place a third of the broccoli into the saucepan.</li>
        <li>After 8 minutes have elapsed, place a third of the asparagus tips into the saucepan.</li>
        <li>After 10 and a half minutes have elapsed, place a third of the spinach into the saucepan.</li>
        <li>After 11 minutes have elapsed, pour the contents of the saucepan into a coriander to drain it.</li>
        <li>Once enough of the water has drained (shake the coriander to speed this up), peel the eggs and place the
            food into an appropriate container for it to cool down in (I use large glass bowls for this).</li>
        <li>Repeat the above steps a further two times.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Storage</h3>
    <p>Once everything has been cooked, wait for the food to cool down (placing it in the fridge while piping hot could
        lead to condensation and bacterial growth in the fridge). Once it has
        cooled down, place the food into the 6 food containers in a way such that each container has roughly the same
        amount of each ingredient.
    </p>
    <p>Having done this, you will have 6 meals that you can eat over the next 3-4 days. The meals can be eaten hot or
        cold. To make the meals a bit less depressing, add some extremely
        hot chilli peppers.

    <h2>Additional Comments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>This recipe can be easily modified to make 2 or 4 meals, if so desired.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It may not be healthy to eat large amounts of certain vegetables, or for certain people to eat certain
                types of vegetables. For example, eating too much spinach could cause
                you to develop kidney stones, and if you are taking blood thinners, then you should not be eating any
                spinach whatsoever. If you have any health conditions or are taking any
                medications, or if you are eating a lot of a certain type of food, then it is worth doing your research
                to make sure that the food you're eating won't cause any harm. Eating
                a healthy, varied, and balanced diet will make it more likely that your body has all the nutrients it
                needs, and less likely that it has too little or too much of certain nutrients.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>This recipe does not represent a healthy, varied, and balanced diet if it is all that you are eating!
                Make sure to eat healthy nuts, berries, fruits, yoghurts, fermented foods,
                mushrooms, etc., in addition to it. Make sure to vary the vegetables, meats, and carbohydrates (for
                example you could use sweet potato or rice instead of the pasta for carbohydrates).
                Subsitute the meat for fatty/oily fish with low amounts of heavy metals/toxins for 2-4 meals a week.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Don't leave the food to cool for too long! Doing so could lead to the growth of unhealthy bacteria and
                potentially food poisoning. It should be fine to let the food cool for up to
                90 minutes (after having followed all the steps) before putting it in the fridge, but avoid letting it
                cool for longer than that.</p>

        <li>
            <p>There are lots of meal prep recipes that are healthy, fast to prepare, and taste good. Search around
                online for other ideas that may work for you.</p>
