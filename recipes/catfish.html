    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fried catfish recipe is a classic Southern dish traditionally served with buttermilk hush puppies and
        buttermilk coleslaw.</p>
    <p>Not wanting to write a third recipe, I copied this recipe verbatim from a recipe online. This recipe is by <a
            href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/mamasmith">Mama Smith</a>
        and you can view it (in addition to things such as comments by people who have made the recipe) by clicking

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound catfish fillets, cut in strips</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups fine cornmeal</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay™</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix buttermilk, water, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour mixture into a flat pan large enough to hold
            fillets. Arrange fillets in a single layer in the pan,
            turning to coat each side. Set aside to marinate.
        </li>
        <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, and seafood seasoning in a 2-gallon resealable plastic bag. Add fillets to the bag,
            a few at a time, and tumble gently until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry fillets in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Work in batches to avoid overcrowding,
            so fillets have room to brown properly. Drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
